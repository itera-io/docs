## Local Development

Follow these steps to run the documentation locally:

Step 1. Install the Taikun docs CLI:

```bash
npm i -g @taikun/docs-cli
```

Step 2. Run the development server:

```bash
taikun-docs dev
```

The documentation site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Port

The development server uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port:

```bash
taikun-docs dev --port 3333
```
