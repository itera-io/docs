You can create a new project right after adding your cloud credentials! During project creation, you have the option to specify various settings and configurations to suit your needs.

### Steps to Create a New Project

<Accordion title="Steps to Create a New Project" icon="gear">
  <Steps>
    <Step title="Go to the Projects menu in Taikun CloudWorks">
      Open the Projects menu in the Taikun CloudWorks platform.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Click the Add Project button">
      Locate and click the **Add Project** button in the top right corner.
    </Step>

    <Step title="Specify Project Name and Cloud">
      Enter a name for your project and select a **Cloud** provider in the pop-up.
    </Step>
  </Steps>

  <Tip title="Optional: Configure Profiles">
    Profiles for **Access**, **Alerting**, **Kubernetes**, and **Policy** are initially set to default. Custom profiles need to be created in advance before using them in your projects.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Certain features in Taikun CloudWorks, such as **Alerting Profiles**, **Monitoring**, **Backup**, and **Expiration Dates**, can be configured or enabled after the project is created.

<Warning>
  If you intend to use a specific **Access Profile** in your project, create it *before* starting the project creation process. This profile can then be selected from the drop-down menu during project creation.
