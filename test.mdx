You can create a new project right after adding your cloud credentials! During project creation, you have the option to specify various settings and configurations to suit your needs.

### Steps to Create a New Project

<Accordion title="Steps to Create a New Project">
  1. **Go to the Projects menu** in Taikun.

  2. Click **Add Project** in the top right corner.

  3. Enter your **Projectâ€™s name** and choose a **Cloud** provider in the pop-up.

     * **Optional Profiles**: Access, Alerting, Kubernetes, and Policy profiles are populated with default options at first. Custom profiles should be created before adding them to your projects.

  4. Certain features in Taikun, such as **Alerting Profiles**, **Monitoring**, **Backup**, and **Expiration Dates**, can be configured or enabled after the project is created.
</Accordion>

### ðŸ”¥ Warning

If you intend to use a specific **Access Profile** in your project, create it *before* starting the project creation process. This profile can then be selected from the drop-down menu during project creation.
