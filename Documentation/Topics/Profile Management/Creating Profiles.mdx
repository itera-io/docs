If you want to use one of Profiles in your Projects, add them in Taikun and select them during Project creation.

<Info>Keep in mind, you should add profiles (Kubernetes, access, and standalone profiles) during project creation otherwise you cannot do it later.</Info>

Set parameters for your Kubernetes profile and choose it from the drop-down selection during project creation.
