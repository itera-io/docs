# Overview

<Note>When using SSH to connect to the servers, **<u>do not</u>** use the user ubuntu; it is used by Taikun for management of the cluster.</Note>

Access Profiles allow you to connect to your Bastion server securely.

Specify the following parameters:

* Name: Choose a name for a new profile, 3-30 characters.

* HTTP Proxy: You can set a proxy server, create a gateway between the cluster and the Internet, and allow access to external packages, docker images, etc. This will also preserve your security, as your own IP will be preserved.

* Add:

  <Accordion title="SSH Users">
    Allow a user to access the Kubernetes API by adding the Public Key (the key type must be RSA, ECDSA, or Ed25519).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="DNS">
    Resolves alphabetic names to IP addresses. You can choose a DNS for your server.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="NTP Server">

<Note>If your Public Key contains special characters (like : or +), Taikun will fail to create the servers in Proxmox.</Note>

<Note>DNS will be ignored if you choose to import network when establishing Cloud Credentials.</Note>

If you want to change any of these parameters, you can do it with the Show button and update the necessary fields.
