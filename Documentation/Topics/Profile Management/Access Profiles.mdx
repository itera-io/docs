## Overview

<Note>When using SSH to connect to the servers, **<u>do not</u>** use the user ubuntu; it is reserved by Taikun for cluster management.</Note>

Access Profiles allow secure connections to your Bastion server. You can also view the last modification details (Last Modified and Last Modified By) in the table.

## Actions

* <Icon icon="pencil" iconType="solid" /> **Edit HTTP Proxy** – Update the access profile.

* <Icon icon="trash" iconType="solid" /> **Delete** – Delete an access profile; however, the default profile cannot be deleted.

## Add Access Profile

Create a new Access Profile to access a specific Project by pressing the **+ Add Alerting Profile** button.

### Parameters

* **Name** – Choose a name for the new profile (3-30 characters).

* **HTTP Proxy** – Set a proxy server to create a secure gateway between the cluster and the Internet, enabling access to external packages, docker images, etc. This setup will help preserve your security as it keeps your IP private.

* **Add:**

  * **SSH Users** – Allow a user to access the Kubernetes API by adding their Public Key. The key type must be RSA, ECDSA, or Ed25519.

  * **DNS** – Resolves names to IP addresses. Select a DNS server for your setup.

  * **NTP Server** – Synchronizes local time with a specified time server, ensuring all clusters are in the same time zone.

  * **Allowed Hosts** – Specify an IP address or range to restrict Kubernetes access.

<Note>If your Public Key contains special characters (such as `:` or `+`), Taikun may fail to create the servers in Proxmox.</Note>

<Note>DNS settings will be ignored if you opt to import a network while establishing Cloud Credentials.</Note>

If you wish to modify any of these parameters later, use the **Show** button to update the fields as needed.
