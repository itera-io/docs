# Add Standalone Profile

To create a new profile for accessing your Virtual Machine:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Head to the Standalone Profile section in the left-hand navigation panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Second Step">
    Press “+ Add Standalone Profile” icon in the top right corner.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Third Step">
    Specify the profile’s properties:

    * Profile name

You can add a Security Group to your Profile, if you want to allow SSH access:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Second Step">
    **Choose a Name**: use at least 3 alphanumeric characters.
