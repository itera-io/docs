# Overview
Use the power of AI to manage your Kubernetes cluster more efficiently. With our self-hosted solution, the AI assistant will help with fixing any issues with your Kubernetes cluster on the go.

Whenever your cluster has any Alerts, the AI Assistant window will describe the exact nature of the misbehavior and provide valuable suggestions for getting your infrastructure back on track.
