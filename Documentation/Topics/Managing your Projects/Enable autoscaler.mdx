title: "Enable Autoscaler"
---

Autoscaling is an essential aspect of cloud computing and Kubernetes deployment, as it enables organizations to manage resources more effectively, optimize costs, and ensure the high availability of their applications.

With Taikun’s autoscaling, organizations can define the rules and conditions that determine when and how the system should scale. For example, organizations can set a rule that when CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold, new workers should be added to the cluster.
