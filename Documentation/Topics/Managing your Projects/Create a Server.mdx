# Adding Servers to Projects

To create a new server, click Add Sever button and fill in all the fields.

You will receive an error message if no flavor has been bound to your Project yet. You can also bind the flavor during project creation.

<Warning>For a well-functioning cluster you should NOT use small flavors.</Warning>

Remember that a working cluster consists of at least 1 Bastion, 1 Kubemaster, and 1 Kubeworker. However, you can also create a Multimaster by creating more than 1 Kubemaster; the number of masters must be odd. If you want to make a multimaster, you must do it before deploying.

<Tip>
  Bastion recommended 2 vCPU + 2GB of RAM
  Masters recommended 4 vCPU + 8GB of RAM
</Tip>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Role" icon="address-book">
    You can choose from several roles for your servers, which are set according to the Kubernetes settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Number of Servers" icon="server">
    Set number for kubeworker or kubemaster, add an odd number of masters (min. 3 for a highly available cluster).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Flavor" icon="list">
    Choose from the list of offered flavors (e.g. n0.xlarge).

    * You can bind the flavors from clouds to the project in Flavour Info.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Kubernetes Node Labels" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Label nodes where you want to send or restrict pods; you can add more labels with add label button, for more info, see Kubernetes docs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>The bigger flavor you choose the longer it will take to create.</Info>

<Warning>Control if you have all servers you need, the creation can take some time (approx. 7 min per server).</Warning>

Double-check if you need all of them because you won’t be able to delete them later.

When the required servers are created, press the Deploy button.

While creating a node, servers get through the stages:
**PENDING -> UPDATING -> READY**
