</Frame>

Catalogs are curated collections of applications and software packages available for deployment within Taikun. To create a catalog, navigate to the Catalogs section in the Taikun dashboard and follow the prompts to define the catalog name, description, and any relevant metadata.

* When creating a catalog in Taikun, it’s essential to provide a clear description of the catalog and the applications it contains

* Only applications whose repositories have been enabled will be visible

* To ensure a successful installation, it is recommended only to bind Projects that are healthy and in a ready state

* Parameter configurations can easily be located by browsing or searching applications within Taikun

* When installing an application, it is possible to specify a version or use the latest version automatically

* If the parameters are set to be both editable when installing and after installation, it is mandatory to configure them before proceeding with the installation

### Install the application in the cluster

</Frame>

* In the Instance name, only alphanumeric characters are allowed

* Multiple projects can be bound to any catalog. When installing, a list of bonded projects will be visible

* Custom Namespace can be input

* If autosync is enabled, applications will automatically sync whenever any updates are made

* Selected parameters can be added/removed while installing applications. Only parameters that are set as “Editable when installing” can have their values changed during installation

* Extra values can be added to the application during installation

### After Application

After installing the application, users can find the status of the application in
catalogs ➡ select user catalog ➡ select installed application ➡ bound projects

<Frame caption="Add Application">

</Frame>

* Inside the application, basic details, parameters, and default values can be found

* Parameters can be edited and applications can be synced again

* Different versions of applications can be selected, note that users can only select the latest version, not an older one

* A catalog can only be deleted if it is empty and has no applications or projects attached, otherwise, it cannot be deleted if a project is bound to it and an application has been added

### Find all installed applictions

* In the Applications section, you can find a list of all installed applications with information such as namespace, catalog name, and bound projects

* It is possible to directly uninstall any of the installed applications from this section
