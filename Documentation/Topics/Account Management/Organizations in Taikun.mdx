Organization is Taikun feature that allows users to be grouped and share information. It is a way for businesses or other groups of users to collaborate and share resources within our platform.

Users are assigned to Organizations, and each organization can have multiple users. This means that you will only be able to see the information and resources created within your organization. This is a valuable feature for Partners who work with multiple teams or businesses, as it allows each group to have its own space within the tool to work together and share resources.

Organizations are managed by Partners, who are responsible for overseeing the operation of the Organization. Each Organization also has its own Manager-owner, responsible for managing the organization’s daily activities, its connected Credentials, and Projects.
