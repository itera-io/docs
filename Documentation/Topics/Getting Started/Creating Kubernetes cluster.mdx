# Adding nodes

The only step left is to add functioning Cloud servers to your Project! A Kubernetes cluster typically requires at least one master node and multiple worker nodes. The master node manages the clusterâ€™s state, such as scaling and rolling out updates, while worker nodes run the actual applications. Taikun requires another third type of server called Bastion, which connects Taikun to your Cluster.
