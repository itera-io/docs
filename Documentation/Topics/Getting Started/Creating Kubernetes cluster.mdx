# Adding nodes

The only step left is to add functioning Cloud servers to your Project! A Kubernetes cluster typically requires at least one master node and multiple worker nodes. The master node manages the cluster’s state, such as scaling and rolling out updates, while worker nodes run the actual applications. Taikun requires another third type of server called Bastion, which connects Taikun to your Cluster.

## Follow these steps described below to create your first cluster within Taikun:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Open your newly-created Project from the list.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Second Step">
    Hit "Add Server" on the right side of your screen.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Third Step">
    Choose a specific Flavor to be bound to your Project.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fourth Step">
    Add three new Servers to your Project. A correctly functioning cluster needs to have 1 Bastion, at least 1 Worker, and 1 Master.

    * (optional) you might be asked to Repair your Project to save the current configuration
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fifth Step">
    Confirm all the changes by pressing "Deploy"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Congratulations!** You have just created your first Kubernetes cluster with Taikun!

Certain changes might be introduced to your configuration either directly from Project Details (e.g. Backup, Monitoring, Profiles) or under specific tabs like updating Access Profile, Kubernetes Profile.

It’s crucial to remember that any changes made to your Project require a Repair of your Project. This step is essential to ensure the changes are properly implemented and your cluster functions as expected.
