# Projects in Taikun&#x20;

A Project in Taikun is a central management place for creating and managing Kubernetes clusters. It serves as a way to organize and manage your account servers. This allows for better organization and enables users to separate their resources and environments. It provides a single place to view and manage all the clusters and related resources. This is particularly useful for organizations that must manage multiple clusters or teams that must manage multiple environments, such as development, staging, and production.

# Adding new Project

You can create a new Project straight after adding your Cloud credentials! During the Project creation, you can specify various advanced features to be added to your Kubernetes Cluster.

Note that a Project can be created by the Manager or Partner of your account. These users can later assign a Project to any other colleague.
