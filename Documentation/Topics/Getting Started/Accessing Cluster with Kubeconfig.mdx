# What is Kubeconfig?

A kubeconfig file is a configuration file used by the Kubernetes command-line tool kubectl to connect to a specific Kubernetes cluster. The file contains the clusterâ€™s server address and authentication credentials. It also allows you to switch between different clusters and contexts within a cluster, such as different namespaces or user accounts. With Taikun, you can quickly generate a Kubeconfig file and use it on your machine to access the Kubernetes cluster you created in the previous step.
