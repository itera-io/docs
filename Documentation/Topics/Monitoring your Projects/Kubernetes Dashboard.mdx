# Overview

At your Project page, select   "Dashboard"

Users can compare metrics across different periods and namespaces without the need for extensive command-line knowledge by using Prometheus queries (PromQL). It helps monitor resource utilization, enabling effective capacity planning and allocation.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monitoring" icon="desktop" href="/content/components/card-group" horizontal>
    The Dashboard is available for your Project if monitoring is enabled. You can read more about monitoring HERE.

  <Card title="Cluster Creation" icon="plus" href="/content/components/card-group" horizontal>
    At least four nodes are required. Read more details about cluster creation HERE.
