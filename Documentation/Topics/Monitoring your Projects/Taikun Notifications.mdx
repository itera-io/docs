# Audit Log

The Audit Log is a feature that allows you to view a complete history of events in your account. It provides a detailed record of actions taken by users, such as creating servers and Projects, adding new users, and activating Monitoring tools.

One of the great features of the Audit Log is that you can filter the events by date, project, user, action type, and Project availability. This allows you to narrow down the events to a specific period, project, user, or action, making it easier to find the information you’re looking for.
