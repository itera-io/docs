# Audit Log

The Audit Log is a feature that allows you to view a complete history of events in your account. It provides a detailed record of actions taken by users, such as creating servers and Projects, adding new users, and activating Monitoring tools.

One of the great features of the Audit Log is that you can filter the events by date, project, user, action type, and Project availability. This allows you to narrow down the events to a specific period, project, user, or action, making it easier to find the information you’re looking for.

If you need to track changes made to your account or audit the activity happening in your account, the Audit Log is an invaluable tool. Head to the Audit Log section from your Inbox and use the filters to view the most relevant events.

Taikun also has the ability to send notifications to your email address in order to help you monitor the state of your Kubernetes clusters. By setting up these notifications, you can stay informed about the status of your clusters and take action if any issues arise.
