# Overview

You can use the Usage Reports tab to monitor the usage of Cloud resources. In every *Project,* you can see the number of used TCUs (Taikun Compute Units) for a selected period limited by *Start Date* and *End Date*.

Sort data by *Project* or *TCU* and filter them by choosing available or deleted projects.

# TCU

* Indicates the amount of resources spent by Taikun to manage your resources

* Total CPUs and GB of RAM used in a Project (TCU = 1 vCPU or TCU = 1GB of RAM)
