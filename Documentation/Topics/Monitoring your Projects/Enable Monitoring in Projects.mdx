Some of the features described in the Available Monitoring Tools are accessible only if a Project has Monitoring enabled. With this step, you connect your Project to other open-source projects, such as Grafana and Prometheus, to access advanced monitoring instruments. With their help, you will be able to quickly determine a reason for the cluster’s failure or quickly define existing bottlenecks that can be re-configured to improve the speed of your product.
