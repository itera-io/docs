The *Chargeback* tab is an overview of prices for every billing rule you set up in your account. Change the *Start date* and *End date* to adjust the measured time period (for example from the beginning to the end of the month).

In the table, you will find:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rule Name">
    The name of the billing rule applied.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Price">
    The cost associated with the rule, either fixed or dynamic.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Start Date">
    When the billing rule starts to apply.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="End Date">
    When the billing rule stops being active.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
