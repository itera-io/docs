The *Chargeback* tab is an overview of prices for every billing rule you set up in your account. Change the *Start date* and *End date* to adjust the measured time period (for example from the beginning to the end of the month).

In the table, you will find:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Rule Name" icon="scale-balanced" horizontal={true}>
    The name of the billing rule applied.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Price" icon="money-bill" horizontal={true}>
    The cost associated with the rule, either fixed or dynamic.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Start Date" icon="hourglass-start" horizontal={true}>
    When the billing rule starts to apply.
  </Card>

  <Card title="End Date" icon="hourglass-end" horizontal={true}>
    When the billing rule stops being active.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
