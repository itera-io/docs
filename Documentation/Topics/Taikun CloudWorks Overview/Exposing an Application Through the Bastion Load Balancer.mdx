# Exposing an Application Through the Bastion Load Balancer

When deploying an application to the cluster, you can expose it externally through the bastion, which acts as a load balancer. To achieve this, you need to configure specific settings in the application’s parameters.

## Instructions

### 1. Define Service Type as NodePort
Set the `service.type` to `NodePort` in the application’s configuration.

service:
  type: NodePort

### 2. Enable Ingress for the Application
Enable ingress by setting `ingress.enabled` to `true`.

ingress:
  enabled: true

### 3. Specify the Ingress Class Name
Set the ingress class name to `taikun` to inform the cluster to use the taikun ingress controller for exposing the application.

ingressClassName: taikun

### 4. Set the Ingress Hostname

#### For Standard Clusters
Define `ingress.hostName` in the following format: `name.<access-ip>.nip.io`, where:
- `name` is a user-defined name for the application.
- `<access-ip>` is the IP address through which the application will be accessible.

**Example:**

ingress:
  hostName: myapp.192.168.1.100.nip.io

In this example:
- `myapp` is the user-defined name.
- `192.168.1.100` is the access IP.

#### For vcluster
If you are using `vcluster`, which uses an access IP in the format `vc-01.vcluster.b916618f.nip.io`, you do not need to add `.nip.io` to `ingress.hostName`. Use the vcluster’s specific hostname directly.

**Example:**

ingress:
  hostName: myapp.vc-01.vcluster.b916618f.nip.io

### 5. Accessing the Application
Once deployed and configured, you can access the application via the following URLs:
- **For standard clusters:** `http://name.<access-ip>.nip.io`
- **For vcluster:** `http://myapp.vc-01.vcluster.b916618f.nip.io`

Replace `name` and `<access-ip>` with the actual values used in your configuration.

## Example Configuration
Below is a complete sample YAML configuration:

service:
  type: NodePort

ingress:
  enabled: true
  ingressClassName: taikun
  hostName: myapp.192.168.1.100.nip.io

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that DNS resolution is configured correctly, pointing `<access-ip>` to the bastion’s public IP.
- The `nip.io` service provides wildcard DNS for any IP address, simplifying access.
- For `vcluster`, the hostname is already in the correct format, so no additional suffix is needed.
