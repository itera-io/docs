title: "Exposing an Application Through the Bastion Load Balancer"
---

When deploying an application to the cluster, you can expose it externally through the bastion, which acts as a load balancer. To achieve this, you need to configure specific settings in the application’s parameters.

# Instructions

## 1. Define Service Type as NodePort

Set the `service.type` to `NodePort` in the application’s configuration.

```yaml
service:
type: NodePort
```

## 2. Enable Ingress for the Application

Enable ingress by setting `ingress.enabled` to `true`.
```yaml
ingress:
enabled: true
```
## 3. Specify the Ingress Class Name

Set the ingress class name to `taikun` to inform the cluster to use the taikun ingress controller for exposing the application.

```yaml
ingressClassName: taikun
```

## 4. Set the Ingress Hostname

### For Standard Clusters

Define `ingress.hostName` in the following format: `name.<access-ip>.nip.io`, where:

* `name` is a user-defined name for the application.

* `<access-ip>` is the IP address through which the application will be accessible.

**Example:**
```yaml
ingress:
hostName: myapp.192.168.1.100.nip.io
```
In this example:

* `myapp` is the user-defined name.

* `192.168.1.100` is the access IP.

### For vcluster

If you are using `vcluster`, which uses an access IP in the format `vc-01.vcluster.b916618f.nip.io`, you do not need to add `.nip.io` to `ingress.hostName`. Use the vcluster’s specific hostname directly.

**Example:**
```yaml
ingress:
hostName: myapp.vc-01.vcluster.b916618f.nip.io
```
## 5. Accessing the Application

Once deployed and configured, you can access the application via the following URLs:

* **For standard clusters:** `http://name.<access-ip>.nip.io`

* **For vcluster:** [`http://myapp.vc-01.vcluster.b916618f.nip.io`](http://myapp.vc-01.vcluster.b916618f.nip.io)

Replace `name` and `<access-ip>` with the actual values used in your configuration.

# Example Configuration

Below is a complete sample YAML configuration:
```yaml
service:
type: NodePort

ingress:
enabled: true
ingressClassName: taikun
hostName: myapp.192.168.1.100.nip.io
```
# Additional Notes

* Ensure that DNS resolution is configured correctly, pointing `<access-ip>` to the bastion’s public IP.

* The `nip.io` service provides wildcard DNS for any IP address, simplifying access.

* For `vcluster`, the hostname is already in the correct format, so no additional suffix is needed.
