<Warning>Recommended repositories contain the applications that are fully compatible with Taikun Projects and are verified by the Taikun security team.</Warning>

When managing critical applications or production environments, opting for trusted sources like Bitnami and Jenkinsci offers numerous benefits. Their well-tested software ensures stability and reliability, instilling confidence in performance. Enhanced security measures and regular updates safeguard against potential vulnerabilities, minimizing the risk of security breaches. Improved compatibility and strong community support ensure smooth integration with various Kubernetes environments.

# Catalogs

Group the applications you would like to install in your clusters into Catalogs. With the help of this feature, you can predefine a selected list of apps that would be later installable in your Projects.
