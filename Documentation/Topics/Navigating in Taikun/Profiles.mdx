*Profiles* tab presents an overview of each available Profile within Taikun. With its help, you can configure templates for accessing your clusters, means to notify your teammates about alerts, and much more. If you want to use one of the Profiles in your Projects, you should add them and select a specific option during Project creation.

<Note>Kubernetes, Access, and Standalone Profiles can be added to Projects only during Project creation; Alerting and Policy profiles can be added to already created Projects.</Note>

# Kubernetes Profiles

Set parameters for your Kubernetes Profile and choose it from the drop-down selection during project creation. Each Profile is characterized by ID, Name, Organization Name, CNI (Container Network Interface), Octavia, Proxy on Bastion, Projects, and Actions.

# Access Profiles

To SSH-access your clusters, you must create an Access Profile first. Here, you can specify parameters for your Access profile – later on, it can be chosen during Project creation.

# Alerting Profiles

Taikun allows you to monitor the state of Kubernetes clusters within any available tools. With the help of Alerting Profiles, you can configure any e-mail/webhook/integration of your choice to send Kubernetes notifications. Learn more about it in the Alerting Profile article.

# Policy Profiles

Policy Profiles refer to various security configurations that can be applied to your Kubernetes configuration. Set parameters for your Policy Profile and choose it from the drop-down selection during project creation.

# Standalone Profiles

Since you can add individual VMs to any Kubernetes cluster established within Taikun, you can configure VMs’ access to match your needs in the Standalone Profiles. Set parameters for your standalone profile and choose it from the drop-down selection during Project creation.
