# Overview

In this article, we’ll go through the essential elements of Taikun’s UI to elaborate on what each section entails for productive work in our tool. 

# Home Page

When you sign into Taikun, you will see the home page as the first thing on the screen. On the top of the UI is a panel with four buttons: a link to our documentation, Search, Notifications, and a button to access the My profile page. These buttons provide quick and easy access to important information and features within the tool.
