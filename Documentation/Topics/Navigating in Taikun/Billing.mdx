To view, manage and monitor the finances of your account, open up the Billing section in the left-hand navigation panel. Here you will find all information related to the payment of your account and the sections of Chargeback, Usage Reports, Subscription, and Payment.

# Chargeback

The Chargeback tab is an overview of prices for every billing rule you set up in your account. The Billing Rules calculate your usage from the moment they have been assigned to an Organization and indicate used TCUs for a defined period. Changing the Start and End dates allows you to adjust the measured period to monitor the exact spending.

The table can be sorted by Rule Name or Price for a better overview.

<Tip>Partners are able to monitor Chargeback for different Organizations.</Tip>
