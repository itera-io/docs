# Overview

<Icon icon="handshake" iconType="solid" /> Partner

*Partner* is a section specifically designed for our strategic Partners. It provides access to a few additional features related to the management of Organizations. These features are intended to make it easier for Partners to manage their affiliated Organizations and streamline their operations.

# Organizations

Arrange your account structure with Organizations which can then be connected with specific Users, Projects, and Credentials. Organizations will also help you to achieve a better overview of each supported site (which can be chosen via the drop-down selector).

# Billing Rules

With the help of Billing Rules, you can create a new rule to calculate customers’ Cloud usage by a specific metric and assign it to any of the available Organizations. The final result can be seen in the Chargeback menu.

Rules can be sorted by *Name*, *Metric Name*, *Created* *date,* and *Type*.

<Tip>Once you bind the organization, a cron job starts to calculate the usage; the billing period starts at the beginning of every hour.</Tip>
