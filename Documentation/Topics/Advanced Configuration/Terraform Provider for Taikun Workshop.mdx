# Introduction

This workshop aims to introduce you to Terraform and the Terraform Provider for Taikun. The latter will allow you to use Terraform to manage resources in Taikun.

With Terraform providers, you can streamline the provisioning of infrastructure components for Kubernetes clusters, enabling efficient automation for facility management. This simplifies deploying and maintaining Taikun environments, making scaling and managing facilities easier.
