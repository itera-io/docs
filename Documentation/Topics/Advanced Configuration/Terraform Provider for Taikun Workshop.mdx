# Introduction

This workshop aims to introduce you to Terraform and the Terraform Provider for Taikun. The latter will allow you to use Terraform to manage resources in Taikun.

With Terraform providers, you can streamline the provisioning of infrastructure components for Kubernetes clusters, enabling efficient automation for facility management. This simplifies deploying and maintaining Taikun environments, making scaling and managing facilities easier.

# Annotations

* Text in this form will be typed as is on the command line.

```
cd workshop/
ls
echo Hello!
```

* This form of text shows screen output, usually the output of commands.

```
task_00/
task_01/
...
Hello!
```

* This format is for code in Terraform’s configuration language, HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

```
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "abc123"

  network_interface {
    ...
  }
}
```

* **You may wish to skip reading information blocks if you are already familiar with Terraform and its configuration syntax.**

# Setup

You will need to install Terraform and the workshop files to complete this workshop. There are two ways to do this. – Read Local setup if you wish to install Terraform and the workshop files locally. – Use the provided Docker image, which already contains everything you need.

# Setup using Docker

## Local setup

Requirements:

* You must have Terraform version 0.14 or newer installed.

* You will need Git to clone the provider’s repo.

Installing Terraform:
This Hashicorp tutorial explains how to install Terraform on OS X, Windows, and Linux.

Downloading the Workshop Files:
Clone the workshop directory and switch to the workshop/ directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/itera-io/terraform-provider-taikun-workshop.git
cd terraform-provider-taikun-workshop/workshop/
```

## Setup using Docker

Requirements:
You must have Docker and Git installed.

Setup:
Start by cloning the workshop repository.

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/itera-io/terraform-provider-taikun-workshop.git
```

## Docker image creation

You’ll need to build the image, which can take several minutes.

```
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build --rm --target bin -t tf-workshop .
```

## Docker container creation

To create the Docker container, run one of the following commands from the root of terraform-provider-taken-workshop.

* On Windows, run the following command in the command prompt (not Powershell).

```
docker run -v %CD%/workshop:/root/workshop --name tf-workshop -it tf-workshop
```

* On linux and macOS

```
docker run -v $(pwd)/workshop:/root/workshop --name tf-workshop -it tf-workshop
```

This will mount the workshop/directory in the Docker container and log you into the container as root. In other words, you will need to run Terraform commands from within the container shell. However, you can edit the files in the workshop/directory with the editor of your choice on your machine.

## Restarting the Docker container

You can exit the container at any time without losing your progress. If you have exited the Docker container, run the following command to restart it.

```
docker start -i tf-workshop
```

## Text editing within the container

If you wish to edit the files in the workshop/directory from within the container, the Docker image has installed the vim, micro, and nano packages. If you are unfamiliar with Nano and Vim keybindings, the Micro editor has traditional Common User Access keybindings (Ctrl-C for copy, Ctrl-Z for undo, etc.).

# Documentation

The provider documentation is available on the Terraform Registry.

## Tasks

The end goal of this workshop is to have an operational Taikun project built solely with Terraform configuration files. By following a step-by-step process, you will discover how various Taikun resources are declared and managed using Terraform.

All your work will be done in the workshop/directory. These are its initial contents.

```
./workshop/
|-- main.tf
|-- taikun_auth.auto.tfvars
|-- variables.tf
```

main.tf contains the Provider configuration, namely its source address and what credentials to use. You will not need to edit this file.

```
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    taikun = {
      source = "itera-io/taikun"
      version = "1.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "taikun" {
  email = var.taikun_email
  password = var.taikun_password
}
```

Terraform reads its configuration from all the files in the working directory with the extension .tf. Having the provider configuration in main. tf is simply a convention.

During this workshop, each task should be coded in a separate config file. Your directory will be organized accordingly at the end of the workshop.

```
./workshop/
|-- main.tf
|-- taikun_auth.auto.tfvars
|-- task0.tf
|-- task1.tf
|-- task2.tf
|-- task3.auto.tfvars
|-- task3.tf
|-- task4.tf
|-- task5.tf
|-- task6.tf
|-- task7.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- users.auto.tfvars
|-- users.tf
```

## Authentication

To complete the following tasks, you must provide Taikun credentials to Terraform. You will need a Partner account as some tasks, such as creating an organization, require Partner privileges. Input variables will be explained later in the workshop. For now, edit taikun\_auth.auto.tfvars and replace the values of taikun\_email and taikun\_password with your credentials.

```
# taikun_auth.auto.tfvars
taikun_email = "jane.doe@itera.io"
taikun_password = "PassWord123"
```

To find out more about providing sensitive data to Terraform, see this Hashicorp tutorial.

# Task 0: Organization

<Info>For this task, please write your code in the file ‘task0.tf’ at the root of the workshop/directory.</Info>

The objective of this first task is to create an organization. All resources created in the future will be part of this organization. As this is the first task, every process step is documented.

Before you do anything, start by preparing your working directory for other commands. terraform init.

<Tip>Terraform init only needs to be run once when starting a new project or after updating the list of providers to use.</Tip>

If all goes well, you should see the following message.

```
Initializing the backend...
[...]
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

Once Terraform has been initialized correctly, you can declare your organization’s resources. Create ‘task0.tf’ and write the following configuration block to it.

```
resource "taikun_organization" "myorg" {
  name = "<name>"
  full_name = "<full-name>"
  discount_rate = 120
}
```

Be sure to replace and with names of your choosing. You can also choose another label instead of my org.

<Tip>Notice the syntax of the configuration block, as you are creating a resource, it begins with the keyword resource, followed by its type between double quotes.</Tip>

The resource type is always lowercase and prefixed by the provider’s name, thus “taikun\_organization.”

Following the resource’s type is a label, it must be unique for this type of resource and is used to refer to this specific resource, as you will find out later.

Watch out, this label does not correspond to the resource’s name in Taikun.

Three arguments are then defined: name, full\_name, and discount\_rate. The argument’s identifier is on the left side of the equals sign, and its value is on the right.

See the documentation of Taikun’s organization resource for a complete list of arguments, i.e., the resource’s schema.

Labels and argument names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens and may not start with a digit.

Run the following command to reformat your configuration in the standard style.

```
terraform fmt
```

Now apply your changes.Tip: If you have already created resources, applying will refresh Terraform’s state by requesting Taikun’s API. If you wish to check the validity of your changes without refreshing the state, you can run terraform validate.

```
terraform apply
```

You should get a validation error.

```
Error: expected discount_rate to be in the range (0.000000 - 100.000000), got 120.000000
Now fix the discount rate so it is in the range 0-100 and run apply once more. Terraform will display a list of
resources to create. After checking the plan is correct, type yes to execute it.
```

<Tip>You should notice a file terraform.tfstate in your working directory, Terraform uses this file to keep track of the state, do not modify or delete it. You may now list the resources in Terraform’s state.</Tip>

```
terraform state list
```

You can also display their content.

```
terraform show
```

```
taikun_organization.myorg:
resource "taikun_organization" "myorg" {
    created_at = "2021-11-05T14:00:50Z"
    discount_rate = 42
    full_name = "Jane Doe's organization"
    id = "6383"
    is_read_only = false
    lock = false
    managers_can_change_subscription = true
    name = "my-organization"
    partner_id = "119"
    partner_name = "TF-CI"
    projects = 0
    servers = 0
}
```

You may wish to check the organization was indeed created at app.taikun.cloud/organizations.Tip

Try running terraform apply again, Terraform will refresh its state and, as long as nothing has changed, tell you that no changes are needed.

You can also try deleting the organization through the web UI, and running terraform apply. Terraform will tell you that changes have occurred outside of Terraform and recreate the resource.

# Task 1: Kubernetes Profile

<Info>For this task, please write your code in the file task1.tf at the root of the workshop/directory.</Info>

Now that you have created an organization, you will create a Kubernetes profile belonging to it. Check the kubernetes\_profile resource’s schema on the provider’s documentation and declare the resource in task1.tf. Set organization\_id to the organization’s ID created in the previous task (see Task 0: Organization).

Feel free to set some of kubernetes\_profile’s other optional attributes, such as schedule\_on\_master and load\_balancing\_solution. Once you have declared your resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task.

<Tip>To refer to the ID of your organization, use the following syntax. resource.taikun\_organization.myorg.id Make sure to replace myorg if you used another label for your organization.</Tip>

# Task 2: Slack Configuration & Alerting Profile

<Info>For this task, please write your code in the file task2.tf at the root of the workshop/directory.</Info>

You will now create an alerting profile using a Slack configuration.

1. Start by declaring a Slack configuration. Here is its documentation.Its hook URL should be [https://hooks.myapp.example/ci.](https://hooks.myapp.example/ci.) It must send alert-type notifications only to channel ci.

2. You can now declare the alerting profile. Here is its documentation. The alerting profile should send notifications daily using the Slack configuration displayed above.

<Tip>As always, your resources should belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization.</Tip>
Once you have declared these two new resources, apply your changes and move on to the next task.

# Task 3: Cloud Credentials

<Info>For this task, please write your code in the file task3.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will also be editing task3.auto.tfvars.Important</Info>

You will need OpenStack credentials to complete this task.

Cloud credentials are needed to create a Taikun project. In a natural work environment, cloud credentials should not be stored under version control Terraform’s input variables help solve this problem.

Variables are declared in variables.tf by convention. This file declares the variables taikun\_email and taikun\_password used for authentication.

```
# variables.tf
variable "taikun_email" {
  description = "Taikun email"
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}

variable "taikun_password" {
  description = "Taikun password"
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}
```

<Tip>Input variables are declared with a variable block. The label that follows the variable keyword is the name of the variable.</Tip>

The description argument is used to specify the variable’s documentation. • type is the type of this argument’s value. • If set to true, sensitive will hide this variable’s value in Terraform output. It defaults to false.

To know more about input variables and a complete list of arguments, see the Terraform documentation on variables.

Variables are then defined in .tfvars files, as seen in the subsection Authentication.

For simplicity, variables will be declared in the task/.tf files. Thus, in task3.tf\*, insert the following variable declarations

```
variable "openstack_url" {
  description = "OpenStack url"
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}
variable "openstack_user" {
  description = "OpenStack user"
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}
variable "openstack_password" {
  description = "OpenStack password"
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}
variable "openstack_domain" {
  description = "OpenStack domain"
  type = string
  sensitive = true
}
variable "openstack_region" {
  description = "OpenStack region"
  type = string
}
variable "openstack_public_network" {
  description = "OpenStack public network"
  type = string
}
variable "openstack_project" {
  description = "OpenStack project name"
  type = string
}
```

<Info>If copy-pasting this code block into task3.tf does not indent the code properly, save task3.tf and run terraform fmt.</Info>

Now that the OpenStack variables have been declared define the variables in task3.auto.tfvars using your credentials.

Terraform must be told through command line arguments which .tfvars files to read. However, if variable definition files have the extension .auto.tfvars, as is the case with taikun\_auth.auto.tfvars, Terraform will automatically fetch the variables’ values.

<Tip>As a reminder, here is the syntax used in taikun\_auth.auto.tfvars to define the variables taikun\_email and taikun\_password.</Tip>

```
taikun_email = "jane.doe@itera.io"
taikun_password = "PassWord123"
```

<Tip>In order to get a variable’s value, use the syntax var.. For example, the following line sets the OpenStack domain in the cloud\_credential\_openstack resource.</Tip>

```
domain = var.openstack_domain
```

Once you have declared your new resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task.

<Info>As always, your resources should belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization.</Info>

# Task 4: Users

<Note>For this task, please write your code in the file task4.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will also be editing users.tf and users.auto.tfvars.</Note>

You will now add users to the Taikun organization. As the organization could have many users, you will use variables and the keyword for\_each to avoid declaring multiple taikun\_user blocks.

Add the following variable declaration to users.tf.

```
variable "users" {
  type = map(object({
    email = string
    role = string
   }))
   description = "List of project users"
   default = {}
}
```

The user variable is of a complex type: a map of objects with two arguments, email, and role. The keys of the map are strings, they will be the usernames of the users. The default = {} argument definition tells Terraform that the default value of var.users is an empty map.

Here is an example definition of the user variable.

```
users = {
  "alice" = {
    email = "alice@gmail.com"
    role = "Manager"
  },
  "bob" = {
    email = "bob@gmail.com"
    role = "User"
  },
}
```

In this example, user accounts are defined for Alice and Bob. • Alice has a Manager account with the username alice and the email [alice@gmail.com](mailto:alice@gmail.com). • Bob has a User account with the username bob and the email [bob@gmail.com](mailto:bob@gmail.com).

Now edit users.auto.tfvars and define three users. • -manager with Manager role and the email [-manager@mail.example](mailto:-manager@mail.example). • -user1 with User role and the email [-user1@mail.example](mailto:-user1@mail.example). • -user2 with User role and the email [-user2@mail.example](mailto:-user2@mail.example).

Replace with a name of your choosing.

You can now declare the user resource in task4.tf, the users must belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization. Here is its documentation. By using the for\_each keyword, only one resource block is needed.

<Tip>Here is an example using the for\_each keyword. Consider a Terraform provider to order pizzas. Sup- pose the variable pizza\_orders has the following definition.</Tip>

```
pizza_orders = {
  "alice" = {
    type = "pepperoni"
    size = "large"
   },
   "bob" = {
     type = "amatriciana"
     size = "medium"
   },
}
```

Here is how it would be used with the for\_each keyword in a pizza\_order resource.

```
resource "pizza_order" "orders" {
  for_each = var.pizza_orders
  client = each.key
  type = each.value.type
  size = each.value.size
}
```

You can also have a look at Terraform’s for\_each documentation.

Once you have declared the user resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task.

# Task 5: Access Profile

<Note>For this task, please write your code in the file task5.tf at the root of the workshop/directory. You will also be editing users.tf and users.auto.tfvars.</Note>

Before creating your first project, you will need an access profile.

The access profile must contain SSH keys for all the users created in the previous task, Task 4: Users. Rather than declare the SSH keys in a separate variable, you will add them to the user’s variable to declare them on per user basis.

Modify users’ declaration in users.tf to include a list of SSH users per user.

```
variable "users" {
  type = map(object({
    email = string
    role = string
    ssh_users = list(object({
      name = string
      public_key = string
    }))
   }))
   description = "List of project users"
   default = {}
}
```

You can now edit users.auto.tfvars and define a list of SSH users for each user. Considering the previous example of Alice and Bob, here is the exact definition of users with added SSH users.

```
users = {
  "alice" = {
    email = "alice@gmail.com"
    role = "Manager"
    ssh_users = [
      {
        name = "alice-work"
        public_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example"
      },
      {
        name = "alice-home"
        public_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example"
      }
     ]
    },
    "bob" = {
      email = "bob@gmail.com"
      role = "User"
      ssh_users = [
        {
          name = "bob-laptop"
          public_key = "ssh-ed25519 AAAATHEQUICKBROWNFOXJUMPEDOVERTHELAZYDOG example"
        }
       ]
      },
     }
```

Add as many SSH users as you wish to the users defined in the previous task. Of course, you will need to use valid SSH keys. If you do not want to create your own, here is a public key value you can use:

```
ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIB/8P0zXmI/Il81+/fnvGrf0X/VyNTrOJ9nQCxBxjc5m taikun
```

<Info>Within one access profile, the names of SSH users must be unique.</Info>

You can now declare the taikun\_access\_profile resource in task5.tf. You will use for\_each slightly differently, as ssh\_user is a nested resource within the access\_profile resource. Here is the documentation of the access profile resource.

The access profile’s requirements are • It should use the DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1. • It should use the NTP server time.windows.com. • It should include all the SSH users defined in users.auto.tfvars.

<Tip>While reading access profile’s schema, you may notice dns\_server and ntp\_server are of the type Block List.</Tip>

Returning to the pizza order example, here is how block lists are used. Suppose the pizza\_order resource argues extra\_topping defined as such:

```
 - extra_topping (Block List, Max: 5) List of extra pizza toppings. (see below for nested
 schema)

 Nested Schema for extra_topping
 Required:
 - name (String) Name of the extra topping
 - quantity (Number) Quantity
```

Alice could add mozzarella di bufala and basil to her amatriciana pizza order.

```
resource "pizza_order" "orders" {
  client = "alice"
  type = "amatriciana"
  size = "large"

  extra_topping {
    name = "basil leaves"
    quantity = 8
  }
  extra_topping {
    name = "bufala slices"
    quantity = 4
  }
<a href="https://docs.taikun.cloud/guidelines/terraform-provider/#__codelineno-32-14"></a>}
```

Spoiler ahead!

Solution: Add the following dynamic “ssh\_user” block to your access profile’s configuration.

```
resource "taikun_access_profile" "..." {

   # Rest of configuration: DNS servers, NTP servers, etc.
   # ...

   dynamic "ssh_user" {
     for_each = flatten([for user in var.users : user.ssh_users])
     content {
       name = ssh_user.value.name
       public_key = ssh_user.value.public_key
     }
    }
}
```

Once you have fully declared the access profile resource, apply your changes and move on to the next task.

# Task 6: Project

<Note>For this task, please write all your code in the file task6.tf at the root of the workshop/directory.</Note>

Finally, you can declare a project resource. However, as flavors must be bound to the project, you must first fetch a list of suitable flavors.

To do this, declare a flavors data source. Datasources, instead of resources, only fetch information from providers and do not create any resources. Add the following block to task6.tf.

```
data "taikun_flavors" "small" {
# FIXME
}
```

<Tip>As you are declaring a datasource and not a resource, the block begins with the keyword data instead of a resource. Once again, the type of datasource is in lowercase and must be prefixed by the name of the provider. Finally, the label “small” is used to designate this datasource.</Tip>

Edit the datasource to search for flavors with four or fewer CPUs and no more than 8GB of RAM. Set its cloud credential ID to that of the cloud credential created in Task 3: Cloud Credentials.

Then declare local value flavors to be the list of names of the flavors read by the datasource. See the Terraform documentation to know more about local values.

```
locals {
  flavors = [for flavor in data.taikun_flavors.small.flavors : flavor.name]
}
```

This will allow you to refer to the list of flavor names with local.flavors, which will be helpful when defining the project.

You now have everything you need to create a project in Taikun. Here is its documentation.

These are the requirements for the project resource: • As with all previous resources, it must belong to the organization created in Task 0: Organization. • It must use the Kubernetes profile defined in Task 1: Kubernetes Profile. • Its alerting profile must be defined in Task 2: Slack Configuration & Alerting Profile. • It should use the cloud credentials defined in Task 3: Cloud Credentials. • Monitoring must be enabled. • It should have one bastion, one kubemaster, and one kubeworker.

<Tip>To access the first element of a list, use the syntax list\[index]. For example, to get the first flavor read by the flavors datasource, use local.flavors\[0].</Tip>

After creating a project with Terraform, one may want to know its access IP. Once you have declared the project resource, add the following output block to task6.tf.

```
output "project_access_ip" {
  value = resource.taikun_project.<project-label>.access_ip
}
```

Make sure to replace it with the label you gave your project. This will display the project’s access IP once it has been created.

<Tip>Output values are a way for the user to output a specific value from Terraform’s state.</Tip>

An output value block begins with the keyword output followed by a unique label. The user can decide which value to produce by setting the value argument.

To know more about output values, see Terraform’s documentation.

You can now apply your changes; expect to wait about 30 minutes for your project to be in a Ready state.

# Task 7: Project User Attachments

<Note>For this task, please write all your code in the file task7.tf at the root of the workshop/directory.</Note>

Now that your project is in a Ready state, you can attach some users to it.

Declare a project user attachment resource with the following for\_each argument, replacing it with the label you gave the taikun\_user resource.

```
for_each = {
  for user in resource.taikun_user.<label> : user.id => user
  if user.role == "User"
}
```

With this block, you can only attach users with the User role to the project. To know more about this syntax, see the documentation for expressions.

Finally, set the proper values for the user\_id and \*\*project\_id arguments and apply your changes.
