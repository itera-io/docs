# Using Mojo with Taikun OCP

The following OS Bundles are available from Metify. Input the values from this table into the `./mojo-manage --os-image` command. OS Bundles are organized by `name` and `version`. The combination of these two fields is unique within the Mojo Platform.

| Name   | Version  | Architecture |
| ------ | -------- | ------------ |
| Ubuntu | 22.04.03 | x64          |
| RHEL   | 8.8-net  | x64          |
| RHEL   | 9.2-net  | x64          |

## [Redfish API Overview](https://taikun.cloud/docs/using-mojo-with-taikun-ocp/)

### Overview

RackHD is designed to provide a REST (Representational state transfer) architecture to provide a RESTful API. RackHD currently has two RESTful interfaces: a Redfish API and native REST API 2.0.

The Redfish API is compliant with the Redfish specification as an additional REST API. It provides a common data model for representing bare metal hardware, as an aggregate for multiple backend servers and systems.

The REST API 2.0 provides unique features that are not provided in the Redfish API.

### Redfish API Example

**Redfish API – Chassis**

List the Chassis that is managed by RackHD (equivalent to the enclosure node in REST API 2.0), by running the following command.curl 127.0.0.1:9090/redfish/v1/Chassis| jq ‘.’

```json
{
  "@odata.context": "/redfish/v1/$metadata#Systems",
  "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Chassis",
  "@odata.type": "#ChassisCollection.ChassisCollection",
  "Oem": {},
  "Name": "Chassis Collection",
  "Members@odata.count": 1,
  "Members": [
    {
      "@odata.id": "/redfish/v1/Chassis/58df2a1b83d44813084b45f9"
    }
  ]
}
```
