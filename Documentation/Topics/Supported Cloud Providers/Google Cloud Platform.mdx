## Requirements for Google Cloud Platform

To successfully establish a connection between your Taikun and GCP accounts:

* Add a new principal for a Billing account

### Create a Service account in GCP

1. Go to [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

2. Select your project from the folder

5. Add a new Service Account and specify the necessary parameters in the **Google** section:

   * As you add the service account name, it will automatically generate a service account ID, which you can copy for further steps
   * In the Service account description, you need to describe what this service account will do (optional)
   * Click *Create* and continue
   * Region **–** choose a suitable region
   * Grant this service account access to the project so that it has permission to complete specific actions on the resources in your project (optional)
   * Grant access to users or groups that need to perform actions within this *Service Account* (optional)
   * Add the ID in the selected project IAM—add—the principal ID that we created in the service account with the owner or editor role

6. Click on KEYS and ADD KEY:

   * You need to create a new key in a .json format for a new Service Account. If you have any existing key, you can add it, but the Principal ID should be the same in the .json file as the service ID

7. Select the project's folder and click on IAM from the hamburger menu
