## Overview

[Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/) VE (Virtual Environment) is an open-source server virtualization management platform. It allows you to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) and containers on a cluster of physical servers. Proxmox VE is based on Debian Linux and uses KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) as the hypervisor and LXC (Linux Containers) for lightweight virtualization.

2. Click on the *Add Cloud Credentials* button in the top-right corner 

3. Specify the following parameters in the *Proxmox* section:

   * *Cloud Name* – choose a name for your Cloud Credentials (3-30 characters, e.g. proxmox-cloud-credentials) 

   * *Proxmox API Host* – Proxmox API Host is a software component that provides a programming interface for managing and interacting with Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) infrastructure. (e.g [https://taikun-proxmox-XXX.XXX.XX/api2/json](https://taikun-proxmox-XXX.XXX.XX/api2/json) ) 

   * *Proxmox Client ID* – Proxmox Client ID refers to a unique identifier assigned to a client or user in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) system. (e.g. taikun@XX!XXX)

   * *Proxmox Client Secret* – a secure string or key generated along with the Client ID and used for authentication and authorization.

   * *Storage* – refers to the available space and resources for storing virtual machine data. 

   * *VM Template Name* – VM Template Name in Proxmox refers to a predefined, reusable configuration and setup for a virtual machine (VM).

   * *Hypervisors* – Hypervisors is responsible for abstracting and virtualizing the underlying hardware resources, allowing multiple VMs to run concurrently on a single physical server. 

   * *Public Network and Private Network*:

     * *Network Address and Mask* (e.g. 78.XX.XX.12/17) 

     * *Gateway* (e.g. 78.XX.XX.11) 

     * *Allocation Range* (e.g. 78.XX.XX.22 – 78.XX.XX.100)
