# Overview

**ZEDEDA is a cloud-based platform that simplifies applications’ deployment, management, and security on edge devices.** It is a central control point for distributing and updating software across diverse hardware, ensuring seamless operations. By adopting a zero-trust security model, ZEDEDA protects sensitive data and applications from cyber threats prevalent in edge environments. Importantly, it focuses solely on managing the infrastructure and application deployment, leaving data handling and processing to the user’s specific requirements.
